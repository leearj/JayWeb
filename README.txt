#1. How to create a server
		1) Create a server using my computer(Tomcat)
			My computer(back end; server side) interact with front-end(client side)
			Personal IP is exposed, required to run the server 24hours, so not recommended.
		2) Using clould server from web hosting company, such as AWS, GoogleCloud, MicrosoftAzure, Netlify...
		
		I will use Netlify from 2), since it is free.

Information: 
	sitemaps.xml: The crawler looks at it and allows us to explore and make our site more efficient to be searchable.
		 uses Crawler(GoogleBot) to collect data and return it to Google. Crawler reads robots.txt and if it says allows access, it reads otherwise it doesnâ€™t.
